          <h2>The Great Plan</h2>
          <p class="great-plan">The Witness of The Cosmic Timeline is constructed upon the ideals that once exalted humanity. The answer to the question, "When is a millennium as fleeting as a blink of an eye?" is "When there is no one to witness the passage of time." The universe is defined and measured by human perception; all concepts and theories exist because humanity exists and is aware. Thus, allowing a millennium to pass in the blink of an eye symbolizes the frailty of humanity when no mind is perceptive enough to witness and define it. Due to this realization, humanity embarked on a plan to combat the inevitable march towards the destruction of Cinetia, rejecting their impotence in front of the universe. They did this by creating a Witness, tasked with becoming the eyes and mind of all humankind, to witness and define time.</p>
